# They Know Your Face Better Than You Do

**Every time you step outside, you're being catalogued:**
- Gas stations scan your face at the pump
- Stores track your shopping patterns 
- Airports maintain biometric databases
- Your phone constantly scans faces around you
- Police cars run real-time face matching

**But you can become invisible. Legally.**

## Physical Countermeasures

### Level 1: Basic Obscuration
**Cost: $20-50 | Effectiveness: 60%**

- Dark sunglasses (not mirrored - draws attention)
- Cap with wide brim (baseball style works)
- Medical mask (socially acceptable post-2020)
- Avoid distinctive clothing patterns

### Level 2: Advanced Techniques
**Cost: $50-200 | Effectiveness: 85%**

**IR Reflective Clothing**
- Baseball caps with IR-reflective material sewn inside brim
- Invisible to human eye, blinds IR cameras

**Facial Hair Changes**
- Fake mustaches/beards alter facial geometry
- Temporary facial tattoos (washable)
- Theatrical makeup to change bone structure appearance

### Level 3: Technical Solutions
**Cost: $200-500 | Effectiveness: 95%**

**CV Dazzle Makeup**
- Asymmetric patterns that confuse AI recognition
- Breaks up facial geometry recognition
- 90% effective against 2D systems

## Digital Countermeasures

**Essential Apps:**
- **Orbot**: Route traffic through Tor
- **NetGuard**: Block network access per app
- **Permission Manager**: Deny camera access
- **Facial Recognition Detector**: Alert when scanned

## Legal Considerations

**Your Rights:**
- You can legally obscure your face in public
- Private property owners can require face exposure
- Some jurisdictions ban masks during protests
- IR jammers may violate interference laws

## The Anonymity Toolkit

**Physical Kit ($100)**
- 3 different caps (rotate styles)
- 2 pairs sunglasses (different shapes)
- Medical masks (disposable)
- Temporary facial hair
- CV Dazzle makeup supplies

**The goal isn't invisibility - it's making mass surveillance unprofitable.**

When everyone becomes harder to track, everyone becomes more free.
