**Your data is Google's product. You are the inventory being sold.**

Google tracks over 2 billion users across 8+ products, building psychological profiles worth $200+ billion annually. Every search, email, location, and video view feeds their surveillance apparatus. But escape is possible.

## The Surveillance Web

Google's tracking ecosystem spans:
- **Search**: 90% market share, logs every query
- **Gmail**: Scans emails for advertising data
- **Chrome**: Tracks browsing across all websites
- **Android**: Location tracking every few minutes
- **YouTube**: Watches what you watch, analyzes interests
- **Google Drive**: Scans uploaded files for content
- **Maps**: Tracks everywhere you go
- **Google Assistant**: Always listening for wake words

**Combined Impact**: Complete behavioral profile used for advertising manipulation and sold to data brokers.

## The Complete Degoogle Plan

### Phase 1: Essential Services (Week 1)

- **Alternative**: iPhone with privacy settings (better than Android)
- **Easy Option**: Use F-Droid for apps instead of Google Play

**Cloud Storage**
- **Replace**: Google Drive → Nextcloud (self-hosted) or pCloud
- **Why**: Your data stays on your servers
- **Migration**: Download all Google Drive files
- **Cost**: $20/month for hosted Nextcloud, $5/month pCloud

**Maps & Navigation**
- **Replace**: Google Maps → OpenStreetMap apps

### Phase 4: Advanced Privacy (Week 4)

**DNS Resolution**
- **Replace**: ISP DNS → Quad9 or Cloudflare
- **Why**: Blocks malicious sites, faster resolution
- **Setup**: Change router DNS to 9.9.9.9 or 1.1.1.1
- **Advanced**: Run Pi-hole for network-wide ad blocking

**VPN Service**
- **Add**: Mullvad VPN or ProtonVPN
- **Why**: Hides browsing from ISP and Google
- **Cost**: $5/month for Mullvad
- **Setup**: Connect before any browsing

**Search Hardening**
- **Advanced**: Use Searx self-hosted search
- **Why**: Aggregates results without tracking
- **Setup**: Host on VPS or use public instance
- **Backup**: Keep DuckDuckGo as fallback

## Migration Tools & Scripts

**Export Your Data**
1. Visit Google Takeout: `takeout.google.com`
2. Select all services
3. Choose export format (usually .zip)
4. Download everything (may take days)

**Browser Migration**
```bash
# Firefox setup script
wget -O firefox-privacy.sh https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js/raw/master/user.js
mv user.js ~/.mozilla/firefox/profile/user.js
```

**Email Migration**
- Use ImportExportTools NG for Thunderbird
- Forward Gmail to ProtonMail during transition
- Update all accounts with new email address

## Verification & Testing

**Check Your Privacy**
- Visit `whatismyipaddress.com` (should show VPN)
- Search private browsing vs regular (should see different results)
- Check `panopticlick.eff.org` (browser fingerprinting test)

**Google Dependency Test**
- Block `*.google.com` in your router for 24 hours
- Note what breaks - those are remaining dependencies
- Find alternatives for each broken service

## Cost Breakdown

**Monthly Costs**:
- ProtonMail: $4/month
- Mullvad VPN: $5/month
- Cloud storage: $5/month
- **Total**: $14/month ($168/year)

**One-Time Costs**:
- GrapheneOS phone: $300-600
- Privacy setup time: 20-30 hours
- **Total**: $300-600 + time investment

**Return on Investment**: Complete digital privacy and freedom from surveillance capitalism.

## Common Pitfalls

**Don't Do This**:
- Use Google services "just occasionally"
- Keep Chrome "for work only"
- Use Google Sign-in for convenience
- Skip the VPN to save money

**Critical Success Factors**:
- Commit to the full process
- Change one service at a time
- Update all logins immediately
- Never go back to Google services

## The Freedom Result

After 30 days of degoogling:
- Zero tracking across your digital life
- No targeted advertising manipulation
- Private communication and browsing
- Control over your own data
- Independence from surveillance capitalism

**Your data belongs to you. Not to Google. Not to anyone else.**

The resistance begins with reclaiming your digital sovereignty. Every person who escapes Google's surveillance weakens their control over society.

Start today. Your future free self will thank you.
